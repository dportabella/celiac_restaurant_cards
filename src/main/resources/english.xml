  <p1>I have an illness called Celiac Disease and have to follow a strict gluten free diet.</p1>
  <p2>I may therefore become very ill if I eat food containing flours or grains of wheat, rye, barley and oats.</p2>
  <p3>Does this food contain flour or grains of wheat, rye, barley or oats? If you are at all uncertain about what the food contains, please tell me.</p3>
  <p4>I can eat food containing rice, maize, potatoes, all kinds of vegetables and fruit, eggs, cheese, milk, meat and fish - <strong>as long as they are not cooked with wheat flour, batter, breadcrumbs or sauce</strong>.</p4>
  <p5>Thank you for your help.</p5>
